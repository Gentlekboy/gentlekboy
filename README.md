### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Being driven to always learn, I have taught myself how to build responsive web pages and web applications using modern front-end technologies (HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript). I am currently learning to build android applications using Java and Kotlin and also looking forward to building iOS applications using a cross-platform language like flutter or react native. I am open to collaborations. 
Here's a link to my portfolio: https://gentlekboy.github.io/gentlekboy/
